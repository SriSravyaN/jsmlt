The JavaScript Machine Learning Toolkit, or JSMLT, is an open source JavaScript library for education in machine learning. It implements several well-known supervised learning algorithms in an understandable, modular and well-commented way. Furthermore, visualization examples are provided which allow you to explore the way different machine learning algorithms work. Ultimately, JSMLT is intended to provide students with a better learning experience when studying machine learning algorithms.

## Development
JSMLT is maintained by [Jesper van Engelen](https://github.com/engelen), and is in active development. It is currently not ready to be used in any production environments.

## Installation
JSMLT is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsmlt/jsmlt). To use it in your project, simply run
```
$ npm install @jsmlt/jsmlt
```

This will install JSMLT into your node project and make it available through NPM's `require` directive:
```
jsmlt = require('jsmlt');
```
